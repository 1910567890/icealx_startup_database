# icealx_startup_database
I made ERD and Schema for some of the incomplete and unorganized columns in Excel. The goal is to organize data stored in a database and facilitate the process of storing and analyzing new data to get insights and descriptions of new startups and their projects.


## description of the data 
The data about startups in a specific field that have founders and funders who help them, whether they are businessmen or banks, and participating projects, in addition to other government details, including details of the startups.
